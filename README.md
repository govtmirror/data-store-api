# data-store-api

Please note the default branch is _dev_, rather than _master_, as all pull requests should go through _dev_ first

* _master_ holds the currently stable branch and is only updated at the end of a sprint
* _dev_ branch holds the latest tested and reviewed code from the current sprint
* _staging_ branch is pulled automatically by the API's server and deployed

All other branches should ideally follow the naming convention of _*JIRA STORY*-breif summary_

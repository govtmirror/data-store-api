                        that permits obligations and outlays to be financed
                        by offsetting collections. Offsetting collections mean
                        payments to the Government that, by law, are credited
                        directly to expenditure accounts and deducted from gross
                        budget authority and outlays of the expenditure account,
                        rather than added to receipts. Usually, they are
                        authorized to be spent for the purposes of the account
                        without further action by Congress. They usually result
                        from business-like transactions with the public,
                        including payments from the public in exchange for
                        goods and services, reimbursements for damages, and

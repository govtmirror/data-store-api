  title: Outbound API
  description: >
                  This is an alpha version of the Data Act Outbound API.
                  Using the following endpoints, you can access published data submitted
                  through the Data Broker. The most flexible endpoints are the POST endpoints, which
                   take a structured JSON object as a payload. The JSON request supports numerous features:
                  * **columns**: Filter the data to only select the specified columns.

                  * **filters**: Filter the data to match a specified clause, such as 'piid equals 1002'

                  * **page** and **page_length**: Paginate large results to make parsing data simpler.

                  * **get_unique**: Setting this flag to 'true' will return an additional response of *unique_values* which
                  contains a dictionary of all available values for each column requested.

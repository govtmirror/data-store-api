  title: Alpha Outbound API
  description: >
                  **Last updated**: 8/29/2016


                  This is an alpha version of the Data Act Outbound API. Using
                  the following endpoints, you can access published data
                  submitted through the Data Broker. The most flexible endpoints
                  are the POST endpoints, which take a structured JSON object
                  as a payload. The JSON request supports numerous features:


                  * **columns**: Filter the data to only select the specified columns.

                  * **filters**: Filter the data to match a specified clause, such as 'piid equals 1002'

                  * **page** and **page_length**: Paginate large results to make parsing data simpler.

                  * **get_unique**: Setting this flag to 'true' will return an additional response of *unique_values* which
                  contains a dictionary of all available values for each column requested.


                  Please note all data is currently notional


                  As of publication on September 6, 2016, the draft DATA Act API
                   on openbeta.usaspending.gov points to appropriations (File A
                   – Appropriations Account), program activity (File B – Object
                   Class and Program Activity), and award financial (File C –
                   Award Financial) data in the DATA Act data store.


                   The USAspending.gov team is actively working to include
                   contract (File D1 – Procurement Award and Awardee Attribute),
                   financial assistance (File D2 – Financial Assistance Award
                   and Awardee Attribute), additional award (File E – Additional
                   Awardee Attributes), and sub-award (File F – Sub-Award Attribute) data.


                   For more information about the sources of the data for the
                   outbound API, please see the Information Flow on our GitHub
                   site: http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/data-model/



                   As part of this iterative, Agile development process we welcome
                    your feedback. Please visit the OpenBeta.USAspending.gov site
                     to provide feedback on the draft API or contact us at

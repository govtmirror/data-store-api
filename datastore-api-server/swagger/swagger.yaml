  description: "**Last updated**: 8/29/2016\n\nThis is an alpha version of the Data\
    \ Act Outbound API. Using the following endpoints, you can access published data\
    \ submitted through the Data Broker. The most flexible endpoints are the POST\
    \ endpoints, which take a structured JSON object as a payload. The JSON request\
    \ supports numerous features:\n\n* **columns**: Filter the data to only select\
    \ the specified columns.\n* **filters**: Filter the data to match a specified\
    \ clause, such as 'piid equals 1002'\n* **page** and **page_length**: Paginate\
    \ large results to make parsing data simpler.\n* **get_unique**: Setting this\
    \ flag to 'true' will return an additional response of *unique_values* which contains\
    \ a dictionary of all available values for each column requested.\n\nAs of publication\
    \ on September 6, 2016, all data is test data and does not represent any agency’\
    s submission.\n\nThe DATA Act data elements include content used to:\n*\tTrack\
    \ the spending of agency budgets (appropriation level)\n*\tShow how federal agencies\
    \ compartmentalize the management of their budget (object class and program activity\
    \ level)\n*\tProvide context for and demonstrate the relationship between agency\
    \ financial transactions and the contract or financial assistance awards made\
    \ by those agencies\n\nAdditional updates will include data elements for agency\
    \ contract award and financial assistance award data (including data on award\
    \ and prime awardees).  Future available data elements will also describe the\
    \ executive compensation of awardees and details about subaward recipients.\n\n\
    For more information about the sources of the data for the outbound API, please\
    \ see the Information Flow on our GitHub site: http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io/data-model/\n\
    \nAs part of this iterative, Agile development process we welcome your feedback.\
    \ Please visit the OpenBeta.USAspending.gov site to provide feedback on the draft\
    \ API or contact us at [fedspending@treasury.gov](mailto:fedspending@treasury.gov).\n"

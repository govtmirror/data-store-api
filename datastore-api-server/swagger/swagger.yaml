  description: "This is an alpha version of the Data Act Outbound API. Using the following\
    \ endpoints, you can access published data submitted through the Data Broker.\
    \ The most flexible endpoints are the POST endpoints, which\n take a structured\
    \ JSON object as a payload. The JSON request supports numerous features:\n* **columns**:\
    \ Filter the data to only select the specified columns.\n* **filters**: Filter\
    \ the data to match a specified clause, such as 'piid equals 1002'\n* **page**\
    \ and **page_length**: Paginate large results to make parsing data simpler.\n\
    * **get_unique**: Setting this flag to 'true' will return an additional response\
    \ of *unique_values* which contains a dictionary of all available values for each\
    \ column requested.\n\nPlease note all data is currently notional\n"
